# Fine-Tuning zephyr-7B-alpha LLM

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and supporting files for fine-tuning the zephyr-7B-alpha model, a large language model provided by Hugging Face. This process involves several critical steps to prepare, configure, and execute the fine-tuning process to customize the model for specific tasks or improve its performance on certain datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- bitsandbytes (for efficient training)

### Installation

Run requirement.txt file or run from the notebook

## Dataset Preparation

The fine-tuning process starts with dataset preparation. Load your dataset in CSV format and split it into training and testing sets. Replace `"your csv file path"` with the path to your dataset.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset('csv', data_files="your csv file path")
dataset = dataset["train"].train_test_split(test_size=0.2)
```

## Tokenization

Tokenize your data using the tokenizer corresponding to the zephyr-7B-alpha model. This step converts text data into a format that can be processed by the model.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha", model_max_length=784)
```

## Model Configuration and Fine-Tuning

Configure the model for fine-tuning, enabling features like gradient checkpointing and 4-bit Adam optimization for efficient training.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, TrainingArguments, Trainer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha")
```

### Training

Set up the training arguments, specifying details such as the number of epochs, batch size, and the directory to save the model.

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=10,
)
```

Initialize the `Trainer` and start fine-tuning:

```python
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=tokenized_val_dataset,
)

trainer.train()
```

## Evaluation and Usage

After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset and save the model for future use.
